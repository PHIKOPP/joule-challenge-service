# Coding Challenge: Digital Assistant Service – Todo

Coding Challenge: Digital Assistant Service

Your task is to create a service that can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform of your choice. The service should be accessible via an HTTP API. The goal of this service is to allow the user to perform two tasks:

1. Define a name and text response string for a digital assistant.
2. Send a text message to the named assistant and receive the defined string.

Constraints

1. Technology Restrictions: You should use Java Spring Boot, and any other technology of your liking.
2. Time Investment: We recommend you spend about 2-4 hours on this task. Please note that the quality of the solution is more important than completeness.

Please provide the following:

1. Source Code: Please provide the source code for your solution. Include all the necessary files and clear instructions on how to run your service.
2. Presentation: Please prepare a 5-minute presentation to explain your solution during the interview. The presentation should cover how your service works, the technologies you chose, and why you made those choices.
